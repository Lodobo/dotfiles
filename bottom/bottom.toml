# Layout - layouts follow a pattern like this:
# [[row]] represents a row in the application.
# [[row.child]] represents either a widget or a column.
# [[row.child.child]] represents a widget.

# All widgets must have the type value set to one of ["cpu", "mem", "proc", "net", "temp", "disk", "empty"].
# All layout components have a ratio value - if this is not set, then it defaults to 1.
